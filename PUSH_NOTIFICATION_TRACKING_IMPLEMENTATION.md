# Push Notification Tracking Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive push notification tracking system that monitors delivery status for each push notification, with special focus on purchase-triggered notifications.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema Updates

#### Purchase Model (`backend/models/purchases.model.js`)
Added notification tracking fields to link purchases with their notifications:
```javascript
notifications: {
  pushNotificationId: ObjectId (ref: 'PushNotification'),
  pushDeliveryStatus: String (enum: ['pending', 'sent', 'delivered', 'failed', 'clicked']),
  pushDeliveredAt: Date,
  pushFailureReason: String
}
```

#### PushNotification Model (`backend/models/pushNotification.model.js`)
Added source tracking to identify what triggered each notification:
```javascript
source: {
  type: String (enum: ['purchase', 'manual', 'api', 'system', 'test']),
  referenceId: ObjectId (dynamic ref based on referenceModel),
  referenceModel: String (enum: ['Purchase', 'User', null]),
  triggerDetails: {
    endpoint: String,
    userAgent: String,
    ipAddress: String,
    timestamp: Date
  }
}
```

### 2. Service Layer Enhancements

#### Push Notification Service (`backend/services/pushNotificationService.js`)
- Enhanced `createNotificationRecord` to include source tracking
- Links push notifications back to originating purchases
- Tracks trigger details (endpoint, IP, user agent)

#### Notification Service (`backend/services/notificationService.js`)
- Modified to return notification IDs after creation
- Only sends push notifications for PURCHASE type (as requested)

### 3. Controller Updates

#### Purchase Controller (`backend/controllers/purchase.controller.js`)
- Captures returned `pushNotificationId` from notification service
- Updates purchase record with push notification reference
- Tracks notification failures in purchase record
- Enhanced error handling for notification creation

### 4. API Endpoints

#### New Push Notification Endpoints (`backend/routes/pushNotification.routes.js`)
- `GET /api/push-notifications/purchase/:purchaseId/status` - Get push status by purchase
- `PATCH /api/push-notifications/:id/delivery-status` - Update delivery status
- Bidirectional sync between Purchase and PushNotification records

### 5. Frontend Components

#### PushNotificationStatus Component (`frontend/src/components/PushNotificationStatus.jsx`)
New component that displays:
- Real-time push notification delivery status
- Visual indicators for each status (pending, sent, delivered, failed, clicked)
- Timeline of status changes
- FCM response details
- Automatic refresh capability

#### ResponseDisplay Component Update (`frontend/src/components/ResponseDisplay.jsx`)
- Auto-detects purchase responses
- Displays PushNotificationStatus component for purchases
- Shows push notification tracking alongside API response

### 6. Testing Infrastructure

#### Test Script (`backend/tests/test-push-tracking.js`)
Comprehensive test that:
1. Creates a purchase
2. Verifies push notification creation
3. Checks notification status via purchase ID
4. Validates bidirectional references
5. Tests statistics endpoints

## Key Features Implemented

### Delivery Status Tracking
- **Pending**: Notification queued for sending
- **Processing**: Being sent to FCM
- **Sent**: Successfully sent to FCM
- **Delivered**: Confirmed delivery to device
- **Failed**: Delivery failed with reason
- **Clicked**: User interacted with notification

### Bidirectional References
- Purchase → Push Notification (via `notifications.pushNotificationId`)
- Push Notification → Purchase (via `source.referenceId`)

### Source Attribution
Every push notification tracks:
- What triggered it (purchase, API call, etc.)
- Reference to source document
- Endpoint that initiated the notification
- User agent and IP address

### Real-time Status Updates
- Frontend automatically fetches status after purchase
- Visual indicators for each delivery state
- Timeline showing when each status change occurred

## Configuration Requirements

### Backend
- Firebase Admin SDK credentials configured
- Redis running for queue management
- MongoDB for data persistence

### Frontend
- Firebase SDK configured
- Service worker registered for push notifications
- FCM tokens managed per user

## How It Works

1. **Purchase Creation**
   - User clicks "New Purchase" button
   - Purchase created in database
   - Push notification queued

2. **Notification Processing**
   - Worker picks up notification from queue
   - Sends to Firebase Cloud Messaging
   - Updates status based on FCM response

3. **Status Tracking**
   - Purchase record updated with notification ID
   - Notification status synced with purchase
   - Frontend displays real-time status

4. **Status Verification**
   - API endpoint checks notification by purchase ID
   - Returns detailed delivery information
   - Shows timeline of status changes

## Testing

Run the test script to verify implementation:
```bash
# Start backend services first
cd backend
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run the test
node tests/test-push-tracking.js
```

## Important Notes

1. **Push Notifications Only for Purchases**: As requested, push notifications are restricted to ONLY trigger when "New Purchase" button is clicked. All other notification types (login, signup, etc.) will not send push notifications.

2. **Firebase Configuration**: Push notifications require Firebase Admin SDK to be properly configured with valid credentials.

3. **User Token Management**: Each user must have registered FCM tokens for push notifications to be delivered.

4. **Status Updates**: The system tracks complete lifecycle from creation to delivery/failure with timestamps at each stage.
