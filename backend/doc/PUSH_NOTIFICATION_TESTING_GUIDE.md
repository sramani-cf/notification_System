# Push Notification System - Manual Testing Guide

## Prerequisites

Before starting manual testing, ensure:
1. MongoDB is running locally or accessible
2. Redis server is running
3. Firebase project is configured with valid credentials
4. Backend servers are running (`npm run dev`)
5. Frontend application is running (`npm run dev`)
6. Browser supports Web Push API (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

## Test Environment Setup

### 1. Browser Configuration
```bash
# Chrome - Enable notifications
chrome://settings/content/notifications

# Firefox - Enable notifications  
about:preferences#privacy

# Clear existing permissions for fresh testing
chrome://settings/content/all
```

### 2. Test User Accounts
Create test users with different scenarios:
```javascript
// Test users
user1@test.com - Primary test user
user2@test.com - Secondary for friend requests
user3@test.com - User with disabled notifications
```

## Manual Testing Checklist

- Browser shows notification permission dialog
- After allowing, status updates to "Notifications Enabled"

**Verification:**
```javascript
// Browser Console
Notification.permission // Should return "granted"
```

---

#### Test Case 1.2: Permission Denied Handling
